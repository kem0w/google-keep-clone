# Google keep clone

### Google keep clone is a clone of well known service from google for notes/tasks and much more.

By doing it, I'm trying to clone the UI almost in 100%(from. list of notes, panel for searching) without bunch of features,
Project for me is some kind of challange, sandbox for new features/packages/compoennts, and playground for good practise for react which I'm looking for in docs/medium/tutorials.

### Live demo

You can easyli check the current version [here](https://keep-clone-app.firebaseapp.com/)

- React (with hooks^^)
- Redux
